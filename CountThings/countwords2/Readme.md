### Document Histogram

In here, we group the words appearing in a text file according to their lengths and draw a basic histogram in C. ;)
It was a exercise question in K&R.

I did it before by using getc().
Well this one is more robust. The result is the same as the last one.

```
total no. of words: 145
no. of words per length:
         1 count:           41 -----------------------------------------
         2 count:           26 --------------------------
         3 count:            7 -------
         4 count:           17 -----------------
         5 count:           11 -----------
         6 count:            5 -----
         7 count:            8 --------
         8 count:            6 ------
         9 count:            3 ---
        11 count:            1 -
        12 count:            3 ---
        13 count:            4 ----
        14 count:            2 --
        15 count:            2 --
