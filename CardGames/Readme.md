This is going to be a cool Cpp project where I will implement a set of card games from scratch. For implementing it, the first and foremost thing required is to have a decoupled generic Card deck class. Then I intend to attach this card deck to any game of my choice may it be BlackJack or Poker.

This will be a great way to master OOP concepts in C++.
